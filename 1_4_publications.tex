\section{Publications}
The work described in this thesis has appeared in several publications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tamang S and Parsons S. (2013a). Semiparametric Clustering Methods for Modeling Chronic Disease Dynamics. \emph{In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, Workshop on the Role of Machine Learning in Transforming Healthcare.}
  \item Tamang S and Parsons S. (2013b).  Unsupervised Modeling of Patient-level Disease Dynamics. \emph{In Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Spring Symposium, Workshop on Data Driven Wellness.}
  \item Tamang S and Parsons S. (2011). Using semi-parametric clustering applied to EHR time series data. \emph{In Proceedings of the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Workshop on Data Mining for Medicine and Healthcare.}
\end{itemize}

In Chapter~\ref{ch:related}, I describe preliminary work for this thesis that appears in Tamang and Parsons (2011) and demonstrates the appropriateness of semiparametric clustering methods for EHR data by comparing the framework with alternative approaches.  I extend semiparametric clustering to continuous-time model abstraction and the nonparametric Bayesian setting in Tamang and Parsons (2013a; 2013b) and this material appears in Chapters ~\ref{ch:new} and ~\ref{ch:expts}.
