\section{Graphical Models}
A popular type of model that provide useful parametric assumptions for modeling time are probabilistic graphical models (PGMs).  In addition to providing the potential for a succinct and natural representation of a temporal phenomena, PGMs can be constructed and utilized to provide new information while controlling computational costs. Unlike distance based metrics that have trouble extending to time series, they more naturally capture temporal correlations among neighboring states, and the importance of recent events relative to those in the distant past.

In addition to providing the potential for a succinct and natural representation of a temporal phenomena, PGMs can be constructed and utilized to provide new information while controlling computational costs~\cite{Jordan03gm}. Unlike distance based metrics that have trouble extending to time series, they more naturally capture temporal correlations among neighboring states, and the importance of recent events relative to those in the distant past~\cite{Fruhwirth-Schnatter11,hoppner:time,Jebara_07,koller}.
