%Using lab test values reported for a population of patients with hepatitis B and C, my first experiment aims to group hepatitis patients with similar stages of liver decline by modeling the dynamics of the lab test indicates associated with liver disease progression.  The second data set is not composed of actual lab values, rather a higher-level signal that can be captured in administrative records.  For a population of patients admitted to New York Presbyterian hospital, this data physicians orders for glucose tests during hospital stays and aims to group patients that are at high and low risk of diabetes associated hospitalizations.
