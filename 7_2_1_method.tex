\subsubsection{Structure}
For the continuous time, multi-state model, I estimated $n$, the \emph{number of states} for the models using a non-parametric Bayesian density estimator.  A summary of the data that was used as input for state estimation is shown in Figure~\ref{testdurations}. Based on the log likelihoods and resource restrictions a four state model was identified, and provides a mapping for each "observation", or instance of contiguous glucose measurements to one of the four states.
